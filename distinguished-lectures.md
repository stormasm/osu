##### The 2023 Robert M. Storm Distinguished Lecture will be held on   

This year's lecture is dedicated to the memory of Bill Lovejoy (1927-2022). Bill earned his PhD in 1972 under the mentorship of Doc Storm. To honor Doc, Bill made a generous donation to establish the Robert M. Storm Distinguished Lecture Series, which will be enjoyed by scholars and the public for years to come.
